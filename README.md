# DOM 

DOM is a small but very flexible library for DOM manipulation in ES6/ES7.

# Build

First...

```npm install```

..and then for a debuggable, non minified build

```npm run debug```

..or for a minified production build

```npm run release```

This will build ./dist/index.js
The resulting bundle contains the entire extension including the CSS which is added to the document programmatically.

# Development

For fast development, use...

```npm run watch```
